# AI Learning Project Setup - Summary

## 🎯 What We Accomplished Today

### ✅ Step 1: Project Foundation
- Created "AI Learning Folder" on your computer
- Set up a professional project structure
- Created documentation and guides

### ✅ Step 2: Version Control Setup
- Installed Git on your computer
- Configured Git with your identity
- Created a Git repository in your folder

### ✅ Step 3: Online Backup
- Connected your folder to GitHub
- Uploaded all files to `https://github.com/hellohimanshu/AiLearning.git`
- Your code is now safely stored online

### ✅ Step 4: Project Organization
Created this folder structure:
```
AI Learning Folder/
├── 📄 README.md              (Project guide)
├── 📄 requirements.txt       (Python tools list)
├── 📄 .gitignore            (Git ignore rules)
├── 📁 projects/             (Your AI projects)
├── 📁 notebooks/            (Jupyter notebooks)
├── 📁 data/                 (Datasets)
├── 📁 models/               (Trained models)
├── 📁 docs/                 (Documentation)
└── 📁 utils/                (Helper tools)
```

## 📋 Files We Created
